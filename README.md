# ⚛️ Blood Alchemy II

**Blood Alchemy II** is a rebirth of the original [Blood Alchemy](https://github.com/AlphaBeta906/BloodAlchemy).

## Features
* 🟦 TypeScript support
* 🚀 tRPC for safer code (most of "the backend" was placed on front-end in the original) 
* 🔥 Next.js 12
* 🔑 Usage of Bcrypt and JSON Web Token instead of just hashing
* ...and more to come!

## Goals
Blood Alchemy II is a re-attempt of the mistakes I did with Blood Alchemy (both in the game and the dev experience.) I want to take things more slowly instead of doing it in Mach 10 just like the original. However, I want also want to recyle and build a foundation of the original and Elementals 3.

If you want to support to this project, stay tuned as we have more in store, and if you want to contribute to the development aspects of it, feel free to create a pull request for an issue!
